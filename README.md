# GPS-Offline-system-for-the-Indian-NAVY
This project addresses GPS data transmission without Internet or Wi-Fi using a GSM-based tracking system with SIM7600EI modems. GPS coordinates are sent via GSM to a base station, displayed on a map, and stored in an SQL database. STM32 microcontrollers automate communication, ensuring seamless data transfer.
